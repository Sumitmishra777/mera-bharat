        <h2>About Brihadishwara Temple</h2>
        <p>
         Brihadishwara Temple, also known as Brihadeeswara or Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a monumental Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. Built by the Chola emperor Rajaraja I between 1003 and 1010 CE, it stands as an outstanding example of Dravidian temple architecture and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural and historical significance.​

History and Significance
The temple was commissioned by Rajaraja Chola I at the zenith of the Chola dynasty’s power and prosperity.​

It was intended as both a religious monument for Lord Shiva and a demonstration of Chola wealth and engineering excellence.​

The temple’s original name was Rajarajeswaram; it is popularly referred to in Tamil as Thanjai Periya Kovil, meaning “The Big Temple of Thanjavur”.​

It continues to function as a place of active worship, fitting the designation of a “Great Living Chola Temple”.​

Architectural Features
The main temple tower (vimana) rises to 216 feet (about 66 meters), making it one of the tallest of its kind.​

Built entirely from granite—transported from sources over 30 miles away—the temple’s massive scale and intricate carvings were achieved without using mortar or binding agents.​

The temple’s shikhara (crowned dome) at the top weighs approximately 80 tons and was placed with ingenious engineering, involving a gently sloping ramp.​

An impressive monolithic statue of Nandi (Shiva’s sacred bull), measuring over 13 feet high and 16 feet wide, is sculpted from a single stone.​

Unique Aspects and Wonders
The main Shiva lingam inside the temple is made from a single stone and weighs about 20 tons, among the largest in India.​

Due to its architectural design, the temple does not cast a shadow on the ground at noon, leading to much fascination.​

The walls feature carvings depicting 81 dance postures of Bharatanatyam, highlighting its cultural connection to classical dance.​

The temple paintings use natural dyes from flowers, spices, and leaves, contributing to its visual grandeur and ecological legacy.​

Cultural Legacy
Brihadishwara Temple is celebrated as the most stunning achievement of the Chola dynasty and continues to inspire awe among visitors and scholars alike.​

It has survived wars and witnessed centuries of additions by subsequent rulers, including the Nayakas and Marathas, who added further shrines and the Nandi pavilion.​

Location and Visitor Information
The temple is located close to Thanjavur Bus Stand (about 1 km), Thanjavur Junction Railway Station (1.5 km), and Tiruchirapalli International Airport (61 km).​

Brihadishwara Temple stands as an enduring symbol of ancient Indian devotion, architectural ingenuity, and the cultural brilliance of the Chola era.
